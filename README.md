# DOMinator - Chrome Extension for DOM Visualization & Analysis

DOMinator is a powerful Chrome extension that helps developers visualize, analyze, and export DOM trees with detailed insights into structure, performance, and accessibility.

## üåü Features

### Interactive DOM Tree Visualization

- Generate the full DOM tree of the current webpage
- Display in a collapsible, searchable, and color-coded format
- Hover-to-highlight feature: When you hover over a node in the tree, the corresponding element on the webpage is highlighted.

### Detailed Node Inspector

- Show element details such as tag names, attributes, styles, computed values, and event listeners.
- Include support for inline styles, classes, dataset attributes, and ARIA roles.

### Filtering, Search, and Custom Views

- Filter nodes by tag (e.g., div, span), classes, attributes, or text content
- Search within the tree for specific elements or properties
- Toggle visibility of certain node types (like script tags or comments) for a cleaner tree view

### DOM Export and Snapshot

- Export the DOM tree as a JSON file, text file, or a visual tree diagram image
- Capture snapshots of the DOM tree at different times for debugging dynamic pages
- Compare snapshots to detect DOM changes over time

### Performance Insights

- Display key metrics like total nodes, maximum depth, etc.
- Identify nodes contributing to layout shifts or reflows
- Find elements with heavy inline styles or large datasets

### Accessibility Insights

- Highlight potential accessibility issues like missing alt attributes, ARIA roles, or improper semantic tags
- Provide an A11y summary report for the entire DOM

### Live DOM Update Mode

- Watch the DOM tree update in real-time as page content changes (ideal for SPAs and dynamic apps)

### Bookmarking and Notes

- Bookmark specific nodes for future reference
- Add notes to nodes for collaboration or feature reviews
